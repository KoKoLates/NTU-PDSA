## Assignment: Airport
There is a small town with n houses. The town needs an airport. An airport is basically a very long, very straight road. Think of it as an infinite line. We need to build the airport such that the average distance from each house to the airport is as small as possible. However, no one wants to walkacross the runway, so all of the houses must be on the same side of the airport. Where should we build the airport, and what will be the average distance?

(Some houses may be a distance of zero away from the runway, but that’s ok; we’ll give them some free ear plugs.)

## Template
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.lang.Math;

class Airport {
    
    // Output smallest average distance with optimal selection of airport location.
    public double airport(List<int[]> houses) {
        double avgDistance;
        // TODO
        return avgDistance; 
    }   

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new Airport().airport(new ArrayList<int[]>(){{
            add(new int[]{0,0});
            add(new int[]{1,0});
            add(new int[]{0,1});
        }}));
    }   
}
```

## TestCase
Time Limit: `0.5s`

* `0 <= x,y <= M`, x and y are integer.
* We guarantee the coordinates are unique
`N` is the number of houses
* We will check your answer by `abs(output - answer) <= 1e-4`

Cases:
* case1: 20 points: `N = 10, M <= 100`
* case2: 20 points: `N = 25000, M < 25000` Special Case(Four samples)
* case3: 20 points: `N = 100, M <= 10`
* case4: 20 points: `N = 1000, M <= 1000`
* case5: 20 points: `N = 100000, M <= 100000`
